### getting started with EJS i18n

#### Setup

Make sure you have setup **node-webmaker-i18n** if not see [express.md](./express.md) on how to do this step before you proceed.

After the setup you will be able to use `gettext` in your `ejs` template file.

``` html
<%- gettext("View as Web App") %>
```
